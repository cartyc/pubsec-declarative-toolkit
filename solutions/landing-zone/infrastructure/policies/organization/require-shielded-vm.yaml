# Constraint: constraints/compute.requireShieldedVm
# This boolean constraint, when set to True, requires that all new Compute Engine VM instances 
# use Shielded disk images with Secure Boot, vTPM, and Integrity Monitoring options enabled. 
# Secure Boot can be disabled after creation, if desired. Existing running instances will continue to work as usual.
